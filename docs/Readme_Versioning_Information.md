General Information about the ontology documentation and its structure
===================
The ontology documentation is structured in a way that different versions are contained in different folders inside Infomodel/docs. Each folder is named based on the ontology version. Additionally, a copy of the ontology file is kept at /InformationModel
For example, /InformationModel/docs/4.0.0 contains all the files required to build the documentation of the ontology version "4.0.0". And the corresponding ontology file is "Ontology-4.0.0.ttl" can be found on /InformationModel

Moreover, the latest version of the documentation corresponding to the most recent version of the ontology is kept at /docs.

The steps required for the documentation process can be found on the readme.md file.
